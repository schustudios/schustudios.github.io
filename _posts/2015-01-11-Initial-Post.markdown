Well, this is my first post, And hopefully it won't be my last.

I hope to use this blog  keep this blog updated regularly with posts about new libraries, opinions on languages, cool snippets on technology, and maybe a few webcomics throw in there from time to time.

Reading about technology from other developer blogs is what inspired me to create a site of my own. I keep up to date on new platforms, libraries, and products by constantly checking [Hacker News][hn], and subscribe to [a few][programming] [programing][swift] [SubReddits][truegamedev] so I can read a few articles inbetween laughing at [funny pictures on the internet][funnypic]. 

I hope to make a few posts that inform and educate others as much as their articles have educated me.
