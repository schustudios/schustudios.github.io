My name is Ryan Schumacher, and this is my website. I am a software developer living in Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from Full Sail University in 2009 with a degree in Game Development.

I currently work at [POSSIBLE Mobile][pomo] where I have the pleasure to work on teams of talented developers producing high quality applications used by millions of people around the world.

From 2011-2016, I worked at [Turner Broadcasting][turner] across two great teams:
- With the Core Video Player team, I helped deliver a proprietary native video player which was used in a number of iOS apps throughout the company, like CNN, TNT, TBS, and Cartoon Network. 
- On the Emerging Technology team, I helped explore how new technologies would Turner deliver a next generation experience of video. 

In my spare time, I can be found experimenting with new tools and software, learning a new coding language, or hacking on a game. 

This site is hosted by [Github Pages][gh-pages] and runs on [Jekyll][jekyll]. The code for this site can be found in its [Github Repo][repo].
