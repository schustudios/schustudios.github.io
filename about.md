My name is Ryan Schumacher, and this is my website. I am a software developer living in Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from Full Sail University in 2009 with a degree in Game Development, and currently work at [Turner Broadcasting][turner] in Emerging Technology.

For the last 5 years, I have been primaraly focused on iOS application development. In my spare time, I can be found experimenting with new tools and software, learning a new coding language, or hacking on a game. 

This site is hosted by [Github Pages][gh-pages] and runs on [Jekyll][jekyll]. The code for this site can be found in its [Github Repo][repo].
